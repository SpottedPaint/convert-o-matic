Convert-o-matic
===============

This is a silly test project because I wanted to learn some python so this is really my hello world in python.

Its built using **Flask** and the passenger_wsgi.py is built to work on dreamhost with a virtualenv but guess you could tweak to work wherever if you know what your doing.

If you have any issues with hosting python/flask on dreamhost you can check out there wiki entry here thats what I did http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Flask

It also uses the very super duper SQLite.

You can see this working in whatever state its in here at convert-o-matic.adamwilson.info
